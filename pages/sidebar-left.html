                <p><br><a style = "color: white">I’m Köax Lione and all I have ever wanted to be was normal. I grew up in a small town in the grassland along the forest's edge called Clover Ridge. There I lived with my parents who harbored the task of providing for the village, going on periodic hunts. They both descended from families of pureblood shifters, where they take the form of a humanoid lion alter ego. As a young child I was on my deathbed and by some miracle my parents saved me, at the cost of my abilities. Although disappointed at first, I was relieved that my abilities did not manifest because I had always questioned my mental capability to enact the violence that has gone down in my family for generations. Being surrounded with violence my whole life I have no moral issue with the act, but I do fear that I will not be able to bring myself to do what is needed in the heat of the moment. I have never been one to seek altercations and conflict, I much prefer to think and weigh out my options. This began to happen more and more as my anxiety began to mount in the few years prior to adulthood, due to the growing voice in my head. This voice inhibited my ability to make decisions and cause a stutter to develop. The voice in my head became more apparent as time went on and its opposition to my beliefs caused me to expend a certain amount of energy each day to subdue it. I was embarrassed by my inner conflicts and hesitated to talk about them. But at a certain point the voice became two overbearing, I brought the issue to the attention of my parents. The worry in their eyes was evident and I could tell that they were withholding information from me. In their whisperin the only word I was able to make out was Gazenaroc. The information would come with age, they said, so I proceeded to  patiently wait and suffer.</a></p>
                <p><a style = "color: white">My wait was cut short by the Prairie Fire disaster that swept across the grasslands. The horrific disaster engulfed my village and panic ensued as the heroes, my parents, were off on a hunt. As I saw life fade before me, I lost concentration and the voice in my head took over. I keeled over as my feline features enhanced and began to take the form of the grand lionfolk. The next part was a blur, remembering bits and pieces, but clearly remember not being in control. With my mind returning and my form reverting, I stood before my people accompanied with applause and gratitude. When my parents returned I told them about my surprise shift, to my amazement they did not look surprised. The questions I had before were increased tenfold and when they still refused, I took it upon myself to learn what was wrong with me. I said my goodbyes and left the village to follow the path of the druid in hopes to understand the abilities I was cursed with. The only thing to guide me was the word my parents hesitated to utter, Gazenaroc, and the fear of once again transforming into the beast that I know not of.

                <img class="imgl borderedbox inspace-5" src="../images/demo/lione.jpg" style="width:40%;height:40%" alt="">
                <p><br><a style = "color: white">I’m Lione Köax and I once fought alongside Gazenaroc in one of the early wars of the animal kingdom. The shapeless one led us to take back our land that was stolen by the humans. While Gazenaroc felt no true disdain for the humans, it was tough for me to fight in a war against our enemies and not feel hatred for them. The constant power struggle spanned decades as the war of attrition ensued. My days of battle were through and I settled down in a village just outside our encampment along the forest’s edge in the grasslands. I found a mate and she helped me deal with the memories I had in war, before her I was a violent wreck. We had nine pups over the next couple years and I was the happiest I had been for as long as I could remember. </a></p>
                <p><a style = "color: white">One dreadful night I woke up to the smell of smoke and the unforgettable cracking of whip. As I darted outside an unrecognizable race was caging up the women and children of my village and I had never felt more hatred and violence coursing through my veins at any point in my life. I frantically searched for my family, killing anyone in and out of my way. After what felt like an eternity, I laid eyes on my spouse and just as I got within reach I was struck and everything went black…                 </a></p>
                <p><a style = "color: white">As I woke up it was almost as if I was seeing through the eyes of another. Looking around this world looked different than the one I was used to and I quickly realized that I was in a different time period. I was not in control of my body, but on exiting the home I could not believe what I saw, it was my village. I would fade in and out of blackness for what felt like seconds for me, but by looking at the outside world I could tell much more time had passed.  As time went on I became more cognizant and was frustrated with the actions that my body was doing. It was unimaginable to not control myself that my anger began to bleed into my host as I could tell he was being affected. From this point on it was a constant power struggle for control. I had no malphesents towards my host, but he stood in the way of me seeking revenge as I had come to the realization that my family was long gone. I began to regain even more senses and one night I smelt that same god awful smell of smoke and burning dreams. I raged within and I could feel myself start to take over. I emerged from my host and crashed out of the home, searching for anyone who needed to be saved by the flames as I failed before. After saving the citizens I began to think of where to go to seek revenge and figure out the people that killed my family and tribe, but I lost control and was once again a passenger. Now that I know that me gaining control is possible I have something to once again “live” for. I also began to question my rebirth as I was unable to maintain complex thoughts before, why was I chosen to return? Is it time for the resurgence of the war? Or a gift of good faith given my leader Gazenaroc himself?</a></p>

                <p><br><a style = "color: white">From a young age I have been gifted by Talven as he chose me as a result of my perseverance to overcome my villages chronic harsh winters and my strive to one day be a warrior, the gifts were to aid me in the wartime that was soon approaching(not sure of an area in Verum that this description would fit, if you know let me know). Talven gave me strength and the ability to enforce my own harsh elements on my foes. My elven village was constantly at war with a neighboring orc tribe over an ageless feud that no one can accurately remember (something like the avatar “Great Divide” episode). I was never considered one of the bigger men amongst my peers and took up the mantle of cleric in the fight against the orcs, this allowed me to show my gratitude for Talven. Years of training lead to my infantry squad achieving perfect tactical cohesion  and inseparable social bonds that formed. Many battles were fought with my comrades and I would learn to call them my family. However… on one fateful day my aggressive nature and overconfidence led us to accepting a mission that brought us far behind enemy lines and one by one our group was overwhelmed and my family was picked off one by one. I was the last to fall, failing to fulfil my duties to my team. After blacking out, the next thing I remember was what felt like lightning shooting through my body and the words echoing in my head “not yet”, the echo still plays. A day or two must have passed and I slowly made my way back to our military camp. I spent the next month or so alone in my tent reflecting on my failure and how I could have done better, guilt consumed me. I came to the conclusion that I was not strong enough and began to recall rumors that have made the rounds through my many years being present in the military, The Guardian Project. The project was usually talked of through second and third hand experience, as the men I spoke with have never encountered their comrades after they left for the project. Despite my lack of knowledge and risk that was innately involved, it was the only way I saw fit as guilt consumed my mind. I saw this as the only way I could ensure that no tragedies would happen at my hand again. The Guardian Project and the production of simic hybrids is usually used for experimental and scientific research, however, this was not my interest whatsoever. My lack of research and patience resulted in me unknowingly signing away my rights, resulting in the painful transformation that turned me into this monster. I emerged from the experiment no longer a medium sized elf, but a hulking aquatic being which took on the characteristics of a crustacean AND THIS DAMN HIGH PITCH VOICE. I was ashamed that I would no longer be recognized by my late family and I dropped my family name, changing it to Rusine(shame). I was no longer able to control all of the pain and rage that has been accumulating for the past years and not long after I emerged from my transformation I let out a massive pulse of thunder and lightning. For the ensuing year or so I was locked up and put through various inhuman tests as a result of my disobedience.

                <p><a style = "color: white">I was being transported to a new facility to be further tested on when, for once, fortune was on my side. My transport carriage was intercepted by a group of bandits only interested in looting. They held no interest in me and I did not waste my opportunity and fled the scene. I found a village to lay low in, observing to see if I could find any trustworthy companions who could help me avenge my family and infiltrate the Guardian Project to eliminate those who have wronged me. The Guardian Project needs to be taken down for its inhumane tactics and crimes against humanity. </a></p>

His leathery aged skin is of a fermenting pear tone with dark moss splotches scattered about. He appears to be in the last quarter of his life, with wrinkles enveloping his face and hands coupled with a variety of scars. His large pointed ears droop below his scalp, that of which having a few strangeling gray hairs that match the goatee on his chin. His left ear is pierced with a dangling golden hoop with an inlaid clear gemstone, which seemed to be more suited for a finger than an ear. Though his body appears tired Mapes’s vibrant saffron eyes house youthful exuberance, complemented by the denial of his waning body. His frequent smile is flooded with small jagged teeth that are crammed behind his lips, resulting in the few protruding snaggle teeth. Jobnot keeps himself and his outfit surprisingly well-kept, albeit a bit out of style. He wears patched-up black linen pants with a beige undershirt and black silk vest,  and completes his look with a velvety steel-blue swallow-tailed coat that's decorated with elegant golden embroidery and black handcuffs. Jutting out from his apparel, his hands and feet are wrapped in gray wool that left his scrawny green fingers and toes still visible. Jobnot is rarely seen without his weathered rapier that has been modified so that it can double as a cane when sheathed, whether that be to assist his walking or his scheme.</a></p>
                <p><br><a style = "color: white">Being born into a family of gatherers, the Mapes, in the Sietch Clan as the runt of the pack I was largely neglected. While Goblin’s are known to be small in size, my mother was so shocked with my puny frame when I was born she proclaimed that I would never be a sufficient gatherer and granted me the honor of the name Jobnot. While disheartening at first, I soon used the time I was constantly ignored to scrounge around the camp learning the workings of the  outside world. I was deprived of any education during adolescence as my place in the clan did not permit it. As I got older it was difficult for me to not spew out my aspirations that have grown through the years. At first they were contained within the tribe, with the dream of one day being a warrior or strategist. When I learned that this would be impossible to achieve within the close-minded system that was in place, not only due to my small size, I began to hint at leaving the Clan. Laughter always followed this sort of talk, only fueling my motivation. At the age of eight I could no longer handle being scorned and demened day in and day out so I finally left the Clan with the little I had. Being proclaimed as a fool by my family I was told of the certainties of failure and the fact I would never be allowed back.

                <p><a style = "color: white">Despite my awful upbringing I have maintained a positive attitude through my motivation and I always love a good laugh. As I confidently strutted down the path away from camp, I realized that my goal to follow my dream lacked the dream part, leaving me to contemplate this until the next town. I realized what I truly wanted was to be free to choose what I enjoyed rather than the harsh confines of Goblin life. I tested my skills at a variety of trades once reaching my first time until realizing I was a proficient salesman. He sold his skills to various vendors throughout the city, selling a variety of goods. On one of his trips to town a beautiful elf was being paraded throughout the streets as her lineage was new royalty that moved to town. I was mesmerized, I couldn’t help myself I start to stumble forward towards her babbling to myself. She smiled down to me and at that moment my heart was stolen and infatuation began to take root. From another passerby this gifted smile would have been more of a pity and awkward simple, but being of Goblin culture this goes over Mapes’s head. Soon afterwards I would find out Dualia was mayor of the Skarek and devote the next few years to becoming worthy for her.</a></p>
                <p><a style = "color: white">I would walk through the city to see her when being paraded around the streets, cementing in my goal. Once these hard working years came to an end I finally saved up enough money to afford a ring to profess my unconditional love to Dualia. On his trip to town I used the rest of my money to buy a nice new blue dress coat, inorder to present myself. Finally when she was in view I puffed out my check trying to forget the nerves that were corursing through my viens. I strut up to this gorgeous woman and profess my love to her, drop to one knee and propose. After a moment of silence she erupted into laughter, along with all the other surrounding nobles. I was panic-striken and as the word began to crumble around me I shrunk back into my pathetic little goblin body. She disgarded the my ring and her guard threw it amongst the crowd, fallen amongst the bustling crowd. In the midst of laughter I scrounged around amongst the crowd frantically looking for the ring. Once found, I darted to the closest ally, crawled into a ball, and cried as I realized that he would never be given a fair chance wherever he went. Especially with the wretched obnoxious nobles ever present. At that moment I vowed to spend my life leveling the playing field between the rich and poor no matter the means, even if that involved stealing, manipulating or discrediting them. With my new cleared head I had a true goal in mind for the first time, which expedited the regrowth of my confidence. I made a vow to myself to never stoop that low as to feel anything for nobles again to facilitate my revenge. As a final reminder of my quest I pierced my ear and hung the ring that caused me so much pain and embarrassment.</a></p>
                <p><a style = "color: white">I have been traveling the last 35 years fulfilling my goal throughout the towns I have been through, acquiring many stories and much experience. Taking advantage of my appearance I leaned into self depreciation when trying to create relations with nobility. In my old age the rapier I once used to promote justice has now seen the majority of its function as a cane, leaning more into my wits rather than his physical skills. In my most recent escapade I was trying to make myself aquantented with the guards of a town so that it would ease the heist I was planing. Unfortunately that night he may have had one too many drinks and he wasn’t as cunning as usual. One of the guards was especially suspicious of outsiders and was asking me pointed questions of my trade and business in this town, getting his hackles raised as some of the things I was sating wern’t adding up. At that very moment a hulking centar approached me and I thought this may be the end of my escapades. By my amazement he was friendly and helped him get out of this bad situation. Pleasantries were exchanged and the cnetar that helped him escape went by the name Cal Isik. It seemed as if Cal had to true destination or plan so I took him on to aid my quest. While I saw Cal as just muscle at first, over our journeys I began to realize how much I had needed a true friend in his life. With his new good hearted, and a bit dull, companion I gained a new spark of youthfulness to each step going forward. Leading us to traveling into The Jungle…
