Slightly grainy with heaps of Citra and a pinch of Eureka in the dry-hop makes the perfect combo to evoke aromas of fresh-squeezed orange juice, hard candies, orange Tampico, lemon zest, and a lovely kick of laughing grass on the finish.</td>

All the perfect people are relaxing starboard side and enjoying their brightly colored tiki drinks and listening to their fancy Spotify Premium, while footed on solid ground we'll soon be alleviating the heat with some Fog Ripper and unnecessarily loud in app ads. Inspired by a blend of various tiki drinks, most notably the Zombie, Fog Ripper is sour to the point of mouth puckering delight and packed to the gills with notes of passion fruit, red sour cherries, oranges, and limes; resulting in an over the top fruity Catamaran of a sour beer that sails across your palate leaving only tart and juicy greatness in its wake.</td>

Every year these hops keep getting better and this year was no different, you’ll see a lot of the same notes in Wax past but with more intense notes of red berry compote, sherbet, papaya, overripe sweet oranges, a medley of tropical fruits, and a respectable dose of the giggle bush. While we love the overall profile of this hop, its best trait still might be its sheer pungency; making Wax one of those beers you can smell from across the bar while your server is pouring it.

Sprinting in the opposite direction from what we were raised on, we brewed a Pale Ale with a bitterness low enough to make it insecure in a locker-room full of Lagers. Using more Mosaic and Mandarina hops than makes sense, Hazy Glue permeates nostrils in its entire vicinity with scents of honeydew melon, cantaloupe, lemon hard candies, and grapefruit. A bunch of flaked rye gives the beer a slickness that other grains just can't provide, blending with oils from the hops and sticking to your tongue in an unabashed display of modern hop gluttony.
